        <p>October 28, 2020: The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also named Mangalyaan, is a space probe orbiting Mars. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched it on November 5, 2013.<br><br>

This is India’s first interplanetary mission and, after Roscosmos, NASA, and the European Space Agency. India’s Mars mission has been the fourth space agency to hit Mars. It made India, on its maiden attempt, the first Asian nation to enter Martian orbit and the first nation in the world to do so.<br><br>

The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC on November 5, 20
The launch window was roughly 20 days long and began on October 28, 2013.<br><br>
The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, conducting a sequence of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres prior to the November 30, 2013 (UTC) trans-Mars injection. It was placed into the Mars orbit on September 24, 2014 after a 298-day transit to Mars.<br><br>

India’s Mars mission is a “technology demonstrator” project to improve the technologies for an interplanetary mission’s design, planning, management, and operations.<br><br>
    
It involves five scientific instruments. The spacecraft is currently being controlled with the assistance of the Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) antenna in Bengaluru, Karnataka, from the Spacecraft Control Centre at the Isro Telemetry, Monitoring and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bengaluru.</p>
